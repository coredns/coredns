# CoreDNS Governance

## Principles

The CoreDNS community adheres to the following principles:

- Open: CoreDNS is open source. See repository guidelines, below.
- Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
- Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration are done in public.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.

## Voting

The CoreDNS project employs "organization voting" to ensure no single organization can dominate the project.

Individuals declare if they contribute as un-affiliated or as associated with or employee of an organization or a company.

Individuals that contribute as un-affiliated are allowed one organization vote. Each company or organization (regardless of the number of maintainers associated with or employed by that company/organization) receives one organization vote.

In other words, if two maintainers are employed by Company X, two by Company Y, two by Company Z, and one maintainer is an un-affiliated individual, a total of four "organization votes" are possible; one for X, one for Y, one for Z, and one for the un-affiliated individual.

Any maintainer from an organization may cast the vote for that organization.

For formal votes, a specific statement of what is being voted on, and in which delay (a suitable amount of time), should be added to the relevant github issue or PR, and a link to that issue or PR added to the maintainers meeting agenda document. Maintainers should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue or PR, and after the delay is expired, the votes will be tallied and the outcome noted.

## Expectations from Maintainers

Maintainers are the bridges between members of the CoreDNS community.
Maintainers actively participate in PR reviews. Maintainers are expected to respond to assigned PRs in a reasonable time frame,
either providing insights, or assign the PRs to other maintainers.

## Changes in Maintainership

New maintainers are proposed by an existing maintainer and are elected by a 2/3 majority organization vote.

Maintainers who fail to meet the principles of CoreDNS community can be removed by a 2/3 majority organization vote.

The list of Maintainers is available in this [document](/OWNERS) and is synchronized with the receivers of maintainers@coredns.io list

## Github Project Administration

the __coredns__ GitHub project maintainers team reflect the list of Maintainers.

## Projects

The CoreDNS organization is open to receive new sub-projects under its umbrella.
To accept project into the __CoreDNS__ organization, it has to met the following criteria:

- Licensed under the terms of the Apache License v2.0
- Related to one or more scopes of CoreDNS ecosystem:
  - CoreDNS project artifacts (website, deployments, CI, etc ...)
  - External plugin
  - other DNS processing related
- Be supported by 2/3 majority organization vote for acceptance

The submission process starts as a Pull Request on the [coredns/coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) repository with the required information mentioned above.
Once a project is accepted, it's considered a __CNCF sub-project under the umbrella of CoreDNS__
