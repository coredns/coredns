package autopath

/*
Autopath is a hack; it shortcuts the client's search path resolution by performing
these lookups on the server...

The server has a copy (via AutoPathFunc) of the client's search path and on
receiving a query it first establish if the suffix matches the FIRST configured
element. If no match can be found the query will be forwarded up the middleware
chain without interference (iff 'fallthrough' has been set).

If the query is deemed to fall in the search path the server will perform the
queries with each element of the search path appended in sequence until a
non-NXDOMAIN answer has been found. That reply will then be returned to the
client - with some CNAME hackery to let the client accept the reply.

If all queries return NXDOMAIN we return the original as-is and let the client
continue searching. The client will go to the next element in the search path,
but we wonâ€™t do any more autopathing. It means that in the failure case, you do
more work, since the server looks it up, then the client still needs to go
through the search path.

It is assume the search path ordering is identical between server and client.
